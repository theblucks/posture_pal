# Posture Pal AI - Support & Privacy Pages

This repository contains the static HTML and CSS files for the Support and Privacy Policy pages for the Posture Pal AI mobile application.

## Files:

*   `index.html`: A simple landing page for Posture Pal AI, linking to the support and privacy pages.
*   `support.html`: The dedicated support page with contact information.
*   `privacy.html`: The privacy policy document for the app.
*   `style.css`: The stylesheet used by all HTML pages for consistent styling.

## How to Host on GitHub Pages:

1.  **Create a new GitHub repository.**
2.  **Upload all these files** (`index.html`, `support.html`, `privacy.html`, `style.css`, `README.md`) to the root of your new repository.
3.  Go to your repository's **Settings** tab.
4.  In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
5.  Under "Build and deployment," select **Deploy from a branch**.
6.  For "Branch," choose your main branch (usually `main` or `master`) and select `/ (root)` for the folder.
7.  Click **Save**.

GitHub Pages will then build and deploy your site. It might take a few minutes for the site to become live. You will see the URL for your hosted site on the GitHub Pages settings page once it's deployed.

With these files, you should be able to easily set up your support and privacy pages on GitHub Pages!
